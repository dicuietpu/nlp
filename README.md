# Similarity Analysis and Plagiarism Detection for Punjabi Documents

## Getting Started

The project aims to create a similarity and plagiarism detector for Punjabi (Gurmukhi) documents. 
Framework implements the following steps:
●	Input Documents
●	Preprocessing- Language Detection, Tokenization, Stopword & Punctuation Removal, Stemming
●	Similarity Calculation
●	Plagiarism Calculation


### Prerequisites

1.	Python 3
2.	guess_language
3.	NLTK
	    

### Implementation

The first step is to input the two documents which are to be compared for similarity and plagiarism. The next step is to preprocess the text contained in the documents. Preprocessing step includes various sub-processes such as Tokenization, Language identification,  punctuation removal, stop words removal and stemming. After the preprocessing step, cosine similarity method has been used in order to find similarity and n-grams approach has been used in order to check for plagiarism. An easy and user friendly GUI has been developed in order to demonstrate the working of the project.



## Code
